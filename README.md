# Portfolio

**Overview**  
A curated collection of machine learning and data science projects—from fake news detection to calorie estimation and crop prediction—crafted to demonstrate practical AI applications across diverse domains.

---

##  Project Structure

- **`FAKE_NEWS/`**  
  A Jupyter notebook exploring NLP-powered fake news detection: includes data cleaning, feature engineering (TF-IDF, embeddings), classification model training (e.g., Random Forest, SVM), and performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

- **`calorie/`**  
  Predicts calorie consumption or burn using regression/classification techniques. Covers data ingestion, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization for insights into energy estimation.

- **`first_crop/`**  
  **A crop recommendation system that predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental conditions.**  
  Leveraging environmental data—such as soil attributes (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), climate variables (temperature, rainfall, humidity), and optionally geographic or terrain features—this model applies supervised ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, KNN) to suggest optimal crops for given conditions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
